      allowed_gateways:
        - 'Stripe_PaymentIntents'

        parameters:

            publishableKey: pk_test_xxxxxx

## Payment Intents

In order to comply with SCA regulations in the EU, this module uses
the payment intents API to generate a payment intent prior to completing
a purchase.

This means that a payment will also have a payment intent ID saved
against it in the database.

The JavaScript to handle generating the payment intent is added
automatically and adds the payment intent ID to the omnipay gateway
form
